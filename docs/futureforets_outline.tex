\section*{Outline}

\subsection*{Introduction}

\begin{enumerate}

\item the baby: with climate change, we need to safeguard and adapt forests, as they play a major role in mitigating its effects

\item the werewolf: most decisions rely on niche models, which may not be reliable in new climates. This can mask significant uncertainties and ultimately threaten the success of forest management decisions

\item the silver bullet: consider a greater diversity of models (scientific approaches, hypothesis) to make projections, gain a better understanding of uncertainties in order to support sustainable forest management practices


\end{enumerate}


\subsection*{Results, discussion}

\begin{enumerate}
	
\item models, methodology = significant and often overlooked source of uncertainty, even greater than variability of different climate projections

\item niche models systematically bias projections towards more pessimistic scenarios

\item which implications in terms  of forest management? 
\begin{enumerate}
\item on average, more nuanced projections = more possibilities to act? more adaptation measures
\item but high uncertainties may lead to \emph{laissez-faire}
\item we want to avoid that, how to translate uncertainties into decision-making?\\
$\rightarrow$ favor forest adaptation strategies resilient to a wide range of possible future conditions.
\end{enumerate}

\item looking ahead: a call to action for both:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item the scientific community:\\
	substantial progress required to develop more reliable projections\\
	proper evaluation of the transferability?\\
	integration of fewer, but more robust models that incorporate mechanistic understanding? simple models can also be great!\\
	going further into uncertainty evaluation? (parameter uncertainty is totally ignored in process-explicit models...)
	$\rightarrow$ us, as scientists, we need to expose these uncertainties if we want forest managers to tackle them (transparency)!
	\item forest managers, policy makers:\\
	rethink the way species distribution modeling is applied to forest management\\
	(afraid here to repeat what I said in "how to translate uncertainties into decision-making"... may need to think about a different plan)
\end{enumerate}
